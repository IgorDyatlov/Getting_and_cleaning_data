# Getting and cleaning data - project

This is the project for the course "Getting and cleaning data". It contains an R script (run_analysis.R), a codebook (CodeBook.md), and a result of the script that was mentionned earlier (tidy.txt). The R script downloads the dataset in a working directory, loads the info about activity and features, loads test and training datasets with only mean and standart deviation, then merges the info about activity and features of these datasets together (also converting activiry and features into factors), after which it creates a tidy file (tidy.txt).
